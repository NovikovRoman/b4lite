// A Cloudflare Worker relay stops forwarding partway through a session and then
// holds the WebSocket open in silence - no close frame, no reset - so the relay
// has nothing to fail on and the client waits out its own receive timeout,
// reconnects, and is handed the same dead route again. Measured against a real
// Worker from a censored network: not one of 73 sessions carried past 17 KB,
// while Telegram's own WebSocket edge carried 1.1 MB on the same box at the same
// time. Record the Worker that did it and rank it below the other transports for
// a while, so the reconnect lands somewhere else.
